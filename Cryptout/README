With this handy program you can encrypt/decrypt the output of another
program by piping its output into the input of cryptout.

Note: You have to use the same release of the program for encrypting and
      decrypting (so don't encrypt with version 1.0 and try to decrypt
      with version 1.1).

Note: If you want to use AES-256 with oracle-java you have to download
      and install "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength
      Jurisdiction Policy Files" for your java version.

Encryption is done by firstly generating a random AES-128/AES-256 key and
then writing this session key encrypted with a given RSA public key using
a "RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding" cipher (which should be equivalent to
"RSA/None/PKCS1Padding" because no block cipher is used) at the beginning
of the system output stream. Also the random initial vector (IV) for the
"AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding" cipher is written to start of the system output
stream. Then the system input stream is encrypted and written to the
system output stream.

Decryption is done by firstly extracting the AES session key and IV form
the beginning of the system input stream and decrypting the session key
using the given RSA private key. Then the system input stream is decrypted
and written to the system output stream.



I AM NO SECURITY EXPERT SO I DON'T CLAIM THAT THIS PROGRAM IS REALLY
SECURE, USE IT TO YOUR OWN RISK.
